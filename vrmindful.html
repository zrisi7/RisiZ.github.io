                        is minimalistic at the same time. Beach, rain,
                         fireplace are the most calming. The color 
                         scheme that was deemed most relaxing and calming 
                         was often taken by the beach. Warm, lively environments
                          are ideal.</p>

                 <p>Optimized to have four different spots to practice mindfulness
                      (not including outdoors) It includes a radio, cards to access
                       anxiety reducer mode, clock to change the time, and the windows 
                       would be able to change the outdoor environment.

                    My next steps are creating the model and creating 
                    the application using Unity for Oculus Quest. Oculus Quest is currently the best wireless VR headset in the market
                     that doesn't sacrifice on graphic performance as it's competitors.

                     <strong> Why VR?</strong><br>
                    VR is the known to be <strong> highly immersive.</strong> There are already many apps
                     attempting to solve the problem of Anxiety, but one thing can't change
                      - the person's <strong>environment</strong>. In some cases, being in a different environment
                       can change perspective. It's a <strong> safe space to practice mindfulness</strong>, and
                        immersive one as that.  Mindfulness is continuing to grow as a trend, 
                        as is VR. Especially since many of us are locked up indoors and aren't
                         able to travel.

                    Coming from Canada where skies are often grey and the most I can see is flat 
                    land in Ontario unless I drive VR. A lot of people associate their room as 
                    somewhere safe, and thus, indoor space they have control of is important to
                     include.
